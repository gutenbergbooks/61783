 /><i>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</i></h2>


<p><i>Donne’s Paradoxes and Problemes are clever
and entertaining trifles, which were probably
written before 1600, during the more wanton
period of their author’s life. Owing to their
scurrilous nature they could not be published
during his lifetime, but shortly after his death
the greater part of them were licensed to be
printed, the <cite>Imprimatur</cite> printed at the end
both of the eleven Paradoxes and of the ten
Problemes being signed by Sir Henry Herbert
and dated October 25, 1632. The volume
was published under the title of <cite>Juvenilia</cite> in
1633, but already on November 14, 1632, an
order of inquiry had been delivered at the
King’s command by the Bishop of London,
calling upon Sir Henry Herbert to explain
before the Board of the Star Chamber his
reasons ‘why hee warrented the booke of
D. Duns paradoxes to be printed’. Perhaps
Herbert’s explanations were regarded as satisfactory,
but, however this may have been, the
King was not successful in suppressing the
book. The volume is a thin quarto containing
only thirty-two leaves, and was printed by
Elizabeth Purslowe for Henry Seyle, to be sold
at the sign of the Tyger’s Head in St. Paul’s
Church-yard. The printer seems to have been
<a id="png.f006" href="#png.f006"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>vi<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>somewhat careless in imposing the licences, for,
although most copies contain the two, copies occur
from which one or both have been omitted.
It is not known through what channels the
publisher obtained possession of the text, but
it is probable that the publication was quite
unauthorized, and took place even without the
knowledge of the younger Donne, who, when he
reprinted the <cite>Juvenilia</cite> in 1652, made no
reference to any previous issue.</i></p>

<p><i>The <cite>Juvenilia</cite> were at once in considerable
demand, and seem to have been bought by
many of the purchasers of the <cite>Poems</cite>, which
were also first published in quarto in 1633.
This is evident from the fact that the two
books are so often found together in contemporary
bindings, the lesser volume usually being
relegated to the end. The first edition of the
<cite>Juvenilia</cite> was thus soon exhausted and a
second edition was published in the same year.
So ineffectual did the Star Chamber inquiry
prove to have been that in this edition the
publisher not only omitted the <cite>Imprimaturs</cite>
altogether and so abandoned all pretence of
having any official sanction for the publication,
but even added to the first Probleme, ‘Why
have Bastards best Fortune?’, which was
particularly offensive to the Court, twenty-three
lines which had not appeared in the first edition.
This edition, as before a quarto and with the
same imprint, but containing only twenty-four
leaves, is considerably rarer than its predecessor.
It is unlikely, however, that this fact is to be
<a id="png.f007" href="#png.f007"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>vii<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>attributed to the King’s having had any greater
success than before in suppressing it. More
probably the demand for it was less, so that
part of the edition remained unsold and was
subsequently destroyed.</i></p>

<p><i>In 1652 the younger Donne, in the course
of his exploitation of his father’s writings, prepared
an authorized edition of the <cite>Juvenilia</cite>,
which was printed by Thomas Newcomb for
Humphrey Moseley. The number of the Paradoxes
was now increased to twelve and of the
Problemes to seventeen, the offensive passages
in the first Probleme being allowed to remain.
To these were added two ‘Characters’, ‘An
Essay of Valour’, ‘A Sheaf of Miscellany
Epigrams’, a reprint of <cite>Ignatius his Conclave</cite>,
and, finally, the <cite>Essays in Divinity</cite>. The
Epigrams purport to have been written by the
elder Donne in Latin and to have been translated
into English by Jasper Mayne, D.D.
They may have been printed by the younger
Donne in good faith, as it seems to be certain
that his father’s <cite>Epigrammata mea Latina</cite>
once existed; but the epigrams attributed to
him in this volume are, as Mr. Gosse has shown
(<cite>Life and Letters of Donne, i. 16</cite>), certainly
spurious, and may well have been composed,
as well as translated, by Mayne, who was an
unprincipled, though witty, divine. The <cite>Essays
in Divinity</cite> had been printed in 1651 for a
different publisher, but they are very rarely
found as a separate volume in a contemporary
binding, for the younger Donne, as he made
<a id="png.f008" href="#png.f008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>viii<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>clear in his preface, sought to temper the
secularity of the <cite>Juvenilia</cite> by issuing them in
company with the <cite>Essays in Divinity</cite>, and in
this way to invest the volume with an altogether
fictitious respectability.</i></p>

<p><i>Even in 1652 the Paradoxes and Problemes
were not printed entire. Another Probleme concerning
Sir Walter Raleigh has been preserved
in the Bodleian Library (<cite class="plain">Tanner MSS. 299,
f. 32</cite>), the copier stating that it ‘was so bitter
that his son, Jack Donne, LL.D., thought fit
not to print it with the rest’. Yet another has
recently been discovered in a manuscript containing
Donne’s poems.</i></p>

<p><i>The <cite>Juvenilia</cite> have not been reprinted since
1652. In the present edition the text follows
that of the second edition of 1633, amplified from
the third edition of 1652 and with the additional
Probleme from the Bodleian manuscript, already
printed by Mr. Edmund Gosse in his <cite>Life and
Letters of Donne, 1899, ii. 52</cite>. The spurious
epigrams have not been included.</i></p>

Inconſtancy.</i></h3>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="dropcap">Th</span>at Women are <em>Inconſtant</em>,
I with any man confeſſe,
but that <em>Inconſtancy</em> is a bad
quality, I againſt any man
will maintaine: For every
thing as it is one better than
another, ſo is it fuller of <em>change</em>; The <em>Heavens</em>
themſelves continually turne, the <em>Starres</em>
move, the <em>Moone</em> changeth; <em>Fire</em> whirleth,
<em>Ayre</em> flyeth, <em>Water</em> ebbs and flowes, the face
of the <em>Earth</em> altereth her lookes, <em>time</em> ſtayes
not; the Colour that is moſt light, will
take moſt dyes: ſo in Men, they that have
the moſt reaſon are the moſt alterable
in their deſignes, and the darkeſt or moſt
ignorant, do ſeldomeſt change; therefore
Women changing more than Men, have alſo
<a id="png.p002" href="#png.p002"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>more <em>Reaſon</em>. They cannot be immutable
like ſtockes, like ſtones, like the Earths dull
Center; Gold that lyeth ſtill, ruſteth; Water,
corrupteth; Aire that moveth not, poyſoneth;
then why ſhould that which is the
perfection of other things, be imputed to
Women as greateſt imperfection? Becauſe
thereby they deceive men. Are not your
wits pleaſed with thoſe jeſts, which coozen
your expectation? You can call it Pleaſure
to be beguil’d in troubles, and in the moſt
excellent toy in the world, you call it
Treachery: I would you had your <em>Miſtreſſes</em>
ſo conſtant, that they would never change,
no not ſo much as their <em>ſmocks</em>, then ſhould
you ſee what ſluttiſh vertue, <em>Conſtancy</em> were.
<em>Inconſtancy</em> is a moſt commendable and cleanely
quality, and Women in this quality are
farre more abſolute than the Heavens, than
the Starres, Moone, or any thing beneath it;
for long obſervation hath pickt certainety
out of their mutability. The Learned are
ſo well acquainted with the Starres, Signes
and Planets, that they make them but Characters,
to reade the meaning of the Heaven
in his owne forehead. Every ſimple Fellow
can beſpeake the change of the <em>Moone</em> a
great while beforehand: but I would faine
have the learnedſt man ſo skilfull, as to tell
<a id="png.p003" href="#png.p003"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>when the ſimpleſt Woman meaneth to varie.
Learning affords no rules to know, much
leſſe knowledge to rule the minde of a
Woman: For as <em>Philoſophy</em> teacheth us, that
<em>Light things doe alwayes tend upwards</em>, and
<em>heavy things decline downeward</em>; Experience
teacheth us otherwiſe, that the diſpoſition
of a <em>Light</em> Woman, is to fall downe, the
nature of Women being contrary to all Art
and Nature. Women are like <em>Flies</em>, which
feed among us at our Table, or <em>Fleas</em>
ſucking our very blood, who leave not our
moſt retired places free from their familiarity,
yet for all their fellowſhip will they
never bee tamed nor commanded by us.
Women are like the <em>Sunne</em>, which is violently
carryed one way, yet hath a proper courſe
contrary: ſo though they, by the maſtery of
ſome over-ruling churliſh Husbands, are
forced to his Byas, yet have they a motion
of their owne, which their Husbands never
know of. It is the nature of nice and faſtidious
mindes to know things onely to bee
weary of them: Women by their ſlye <em>changeableneſſe</em>,
and pleaſing doubleneſſe, prevent
even the miſlike of thoſe, for they can never
be ſo well knowne, but that there is ſtill
more unknowne. Every Woman is a <em>Science</em>;
for hee that plods upon a Woman all his life
<a id="png.p004" href="#png.p004"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>long, ſhall at length find himſelfe ſhort of
the knowledge of her: they are borne to
take downe the pride of wit, and ambition
of wiſedome, making <em>fooles</em> wiſe in the adventuring
to winne them, <em>wiſemen</em> fooles in
conceit of loſing their labours; witty men
ſtarke mad, being confounded with their uncertaineties.
<em>Philoſophers</em> write againſt them
for ſpight, not deſert, that having attained
to ſome knowledge in all other things, in
them onely they know nothing, but are
meerely ignorant: <em>Active</em> and <em>Experienced</em>
men raile againſt them, becauſe they love in
their liveleſſe and decrepit age, when all
goodneſſe leaves them. Theſe envious <em>Libellers</em>
ballad againſt them, becauſe having
nothing in themſelves able to deſerve their
love, they maliciouſly diſcommend all they
cannot obtaine, thinking to make men beleeve
they know much, becauſe they are
able to diſpraiſe much, and rage againſt
<em>Inconſtancy</em>, when they were never admitted
into ſo much favour as to be forſaken. In
mine Opinion ſuch men are happy that
Women are <em>Inconſtant</em>, for ſo may they
chance to bee beloved of ſome excellent
Women (when it comes to their turne) out
of their <em>Inconſtancy</em> and mutability, though
not out of their owne deſert. And what
<a id="png.p005" href="#png.p005"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>reaſon is there to clog any Woman with one
Man, bee hee never ſo ſingular? Women
had rather, and it is farre better and more
Iudiciall to enjoy all the vertues in ſeverall
Men, than but ſome of them in one, for
otherwiſe they loſe their taſte, like divers
ſorts of meat minced together in one diſh:
and to have all excellencies in one Man
(if it were poſſible) is <em>Confuſion</em> and <em>Diverſity</em>.
Now who can deny, but ſuch as are obſtinately
bent to undervalue their worth,
are thoſe that have not ſoule enough to
comprehend their excellency, Women being
the moſt excellenteſt Creatures, in that Man
is able to ſubject all things elſe, and to grow
wiſe in every thing, but ſtill perſiſts a foole
in Woman? The greateſt <em>Scholler</em>, if hee once
take a Wife, is found ſo unlearned, that he
muſt begin his <em>Horne-booke</em>, and all is by
<em>Inconſtancy</em>. To conclude therefore; this
name of <em>Inconſtancy</em>, which hath ſo much
beene poyſoned with ſlaunders, ought to
bee changed into <em>variety</em>, for the which the
world is ſo delightfull, <em>and a Woman for
that the moſt delightfull thing in this world</em>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="dropcapw">Wh</span>o reads this <em>Paradox</em> but
thinks mee more <em>fantaſtike</em>
now, than I was yeſterday,
when I did not think thus:
And if one day make this
ſenſible change in men,
what will the burthen of many yeeres? To
bee <em>fantaſtike</em> in <em>young men</em> is <em>conceiptfull diſtemperature</em>,
and a <em>witty madneſſe</em>; but in <em>old
men</em>, whoſe ſenſes are withered, it becomes
<em>naturall</em>, therefore more full and perfect.
For as when wee <em>ſleepe</em> our <em>fancy</em> is moſt
ſtrong; ſo it is in <em>age</em>, which is a <em>ſlumber</em> of
the <em>deepe ſleepe of death</em>. They taxe us of <em>Inconſtancy</em>,
which in themſelves <em>young</em> they
allowed; ſo that reprooving that which they
did approove, their <em>Inconſtancy</em> exceedeth
ours, becauſe they have changed <em>once more</em>
then wee. Yea, they are more idlely buſied
in <em>conceited apparell</em> then wee; for we, when
<a id="png.p020" href="#png.p020"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>we are <em>melancholy</em>, weare <em>blacke</em>; when <em>luſty</em>,

others indifferent; but they preſcribe <em>lawes</em>,
and conſtraine the <em>Noble</em>, the <em>Scholer</em>, the
<em>Merchant</em>, and all <em>Eſtates</em> to a certaine <em>habit</em>.
The <em>old men</em> of our time have changed with
patience their owne <em>bodies</em>, much of their
<em>lawes</em>, much of their <em>languages</em>; yea their
<em>Religion</em>, yet they accuſe us. To be <em>Amorous</em>
is proper and <em>naturall</em> in a <em>young man</em>, but in
an <em>old man</em> most <em>fantaſtike</em>. And that <em>ridling
humour</em> of <em>Iealouſie</em>, which ſeekes and would
not finde, which requires and repents his
knowledge, is in them moſt common, yet
moſt <em>fantaſtike</em>. Yea, that which falls never
in <em>young men</em>, is in them moſt <em>fantaſtike</em> and
<em>naturall</em>, that is, <em>Covetouſneſſe</em>; even at their
<em>journeyes end</em> to make great proviſion. Is any
<em>habit</em> of <em>young men</em> ſo <em>fantaſtike</em>, as in the
hotteſt ſeaſons to be <em>double-gowned</em> or <em>hooded</em>
like our <em>Elders</em>? Or ſeemes it ſo <em>ridiculous</em> to
weare long haire, as to weare <em>none</em>. Truely,
as among the <em>Philoſophers</em>, the <em>Skeptike</em>, which
<em>doubts all</em>, was more contentious, then either
the <em>Dogmatike</em> which <em>affirmes</em>, or <em>Academike</em>
which <em>denyes all</em>; ſo are theſe uncertaine
<em>Elders</em>, which both cals them <em>fantaſtike</em> which
follow others <em>inventions</em>, and them alſo which

We have received that even the <em>extremity</em>

commonly doth) envy him. But alas! ſhall
a <em>wiſeman</em>, which may not onely not <em>envy</em>,
but not <em>pitty</em> this <em>monſter</em>, do nothing? Yes,
let him <em>laugh</em>. And if one of theſe <em>hot cholerike

one <em>ſparke</em> of <em>diſgrace</em>, he, like a <em>thatcht houſe</em>

hath a more <em>maſculine</em> force in begetting
this <em>love</em>, then the <em>vertues</em> of the <em>minde</em>: for
it ſtrikes us <em>ſuddenly</em>, and poſſeſſeth us <em>immoderately</em>;

a <em>little</em>, may <em>gild</em> and <em>enamell</em>, yea and transforme

which are great <em>vertuous</em> gifts of the <em>minde</em>,
this <em>diſcretion</em> will be to him the <em>ſoule</em> &amp; <em>Elixir</em>
of all <em>vertues</em>, ſo that touched with this, even
<em>pride</em> ſhal be made <em>humility</em>; and <em>Cowardice</em>,

honeſt and lawfull termes, when juſt reaſon
requireth; and untill then, is kept with a
modeſt chaſtity of Body and Mind. Some
perchance will say that <em>Virginity</em> is in us by
<em>Nature</em>, and therefore no <em>vertue</em>. True, as
it is in us by <em>Nature</em>, it is neither a <em>Vertue</em>
nor <em>Vice</em>, and is onely in the body: (as in
Infants, Children, and such as are incapable
of parting from it). But that <em>Virginity</em> which
is in Man or Woman of perfect age, is not
in them by <em>Nature</em>: <em>Nature</em> is the greateſt
enemy to it, and with moſt ſubtile allurements
ſeeks the over-throw of it, continually
beating againſt it with her <em>Engines</em>, and
<a id="png.p035" href="#png.p035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>giving ſuch forcible aſſaults to it, that it is
a ſtrong and more then ordinary <em>vertue</em> to
hold out till marriage. <em>Ethick</em> Philoſophy
ſaith, <em>That no Vertue is corrupted, or is taken
away by that which is good</em>: Hereupon ſome
may ſay, that <em>Virginity</em> is therefore no vertue,
being taken away by marriage. <em>Virginity</em>
is no otherwiſe taken away by marriage,
then is the light of the ſtarres by a
greater light (the light of the Sun:) or as
a leſſe Title is taken away by a greater:
(an Eſquire by being created an Earle) yet
<em>Virginity</em> is a <em>vertue</em>, and hath her Throne
in the middle: The extreams are, in <em>Exceſſe</em>;
to violate it before marriage; in defect, not
to marry. In ripe years as ſoon as reaſon
perſwades, and opportunity admits, Theſe
extreams are equally removed from the
mean: The exceſſe proceeds from <em>Luſt</em>, the
defect from <em>Peeviſhneſſe</em>, <em>Pride</em> and <em>Stupidity</em>.
There is an old Proverb, That, <cite>they that dy
maids, muſt lead Apes in Hell</cite>. An Ape is a
ridiculous and unprofitable Beaſt, whoſe
fleſh is not good for meat, nor its back for
burden, nor is it commodious to keep an
houſe: and perchance for the unprofitableneſſe
of this Beaſt did this proverb come up:
For surely nothing is more unprofitable in
the Commonwealth of <em>Nature</em>, then they
<a id="png.p036" href="#png.p036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that dy old maids, becauſe they refuſe to
be uſed to that end for which they were
only made. The Ape bringeth forth her
young, for the moſt part by twins; that
which ſhe loves beſt, ſhe killeth by preſſing
it too hard: so fooliſh maids ſoothing themſelves
with a falſe conceit of <em>vertue</em>, in fond
obſtinacie, live and die maids; and ſo not
only kill in themſelves the <em>vertue</em> of <em>Virginity</em>,
and of a Vertue make it a Vice, but
they also accuſe their parents in condemning
marriage. If this application hold not
touch, yet there may be an excellent one
gathered from an Apes tender love to Conies
in keeping them from the Weaſel and Ferret.
From this ſimilitude of an Ape &amp; an
old Maid did the aforeſaid proverb firſt
ariſe. But alas, there are ſome old Maids
that are <em>Virgins</em> much againſt their wills,
and fain would change their <em>Virgin-life</em> for
a <em>Married</em>: ſuch if they never have had any
offer of fit Huſbands, are in ſome ſort excuſable,
and their willingneſſe, their deſire
to marry, and their forbearance from all
diſhoneſt, and unlawful copulation, may be
a kind of inclination to <em>vertue</em>, although
not <em>Vertue</em> it ſelfe. This <em>Virtue</em> of <em>Virginity</em>
(though it be ſmall and fruitleſſe) it is an
extraordinary, and no common <em>Vertue</em>. All
<a id="png.p037" href="#png.p037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>other <em>Vertues</em> lodge in the <em>Will</em> (it is the
<em>Will</em> that makes them <em>vertues</em>.) But it is the
unwillingneſſe to keep it, the deſire to forſake
it, that makes this a <em>vertue</em>. As in the
naturall generation and formation made of
the ſeed in the womb of a woman, the
body is joynted and organized about the
28 day, and so it begins to be no more an
<em>Embrion</em>, but capable as a matter prepared
to its form to receive the ſoule, which
faileth not to inſinuate and inneſt it ſelfe
into the body about the fortieth day; about
the third month it hath motion and ſenſe:
Even ſo <em>Virginity</em> is an <em>Embrion</em>, an unfaſhioned
lump, till it attain to a certain
time, which is about twelve years of age in
women, fourteen in men, and then it beginneth
to have the ſoule of <em>Love</em> infuſed
into it, and to become a <em>vertue</em>: There is alſo
a certain limited time when it ceaſeth to be
a <em>vertue</em>, which in men is about fourty, in
women about thirty years of age: yea, the
loſſe of ſo much time makes their <em>Virginity</em>
a <em>Vice</em>, were not their endeavour wholly bent,
and their deſires altogether fixt upon marriage:
In Harveſt time do we not account it
a great vice of ſloath and negligence in a
Huſband-man, to overſlip a week or ten
dayes after his fruits are fully ripe; May we
<a id="png.p038" href="#png.p038"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not much more account it a more heynous
vice, for a <em>Virgin</em> to let her Fruit (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">in potentia</cite>)
conſume and rot to nothing, and to let the
<em>vertue</em> of her <em>Virginity</em> degenerate into <em>Vice</em>,
(for <em>Virginity</em> ever kept is ever loſt.) Avarice
is the greateſt deadly ſin next Pride: it takes
more pleaſure in hoording Treaſure then in
making uſe of it, and will neither let the
poſſeſſor nor others take benefit by it during
the Miſers life; yet it remains intire, and
when the Miſer dies muſt come to ſom body.
<em>Virginity</em> ever kept, is a vice far worſe then
Avarice, it will neither let the poſſeſſor nor
others take benefit by it, nor can it be bequeathed
to any: with long keeping it decayes
and withers, and becomes corrupt and
nothing worth. Thus ſeeing that <em>Virginity</em>
becomes a vice in defect, by exceeding a
limited time; I counſell all female <em>Virgins</em> to
make choyce of ſome <em>Paracelſian</em> for their
Phyſitian, to prevent the death of that <em>Vertue</em>:
The <em>Paracelſians</em> (curing like by like)
ſay, That if the lives of living Creatures
could be taken down, they would make us
immortall. By this rule, female <em>Virgins</em> by
a diſcreet marriage ſhould ſwallow down
into their <em>Virginity</em> another <em>Virginity</em>, and
devour ſuch a life &amp; ſpirit into their
womb, that it might make them as it were,
<a id="png.p039" href="#png.p039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>immortall here on earth, beſides their perfect
immortality in heaven: And that <em>Vertue</em>
which otherwiſe would putrifie and corrupt,
ſhall then be compleat; and ſhall be
recorded in Heaven, and enrolled here on
Earth; and the name of <em>Virgin</em> ſhall be exchanged
for a far more honorable name,
<em>A Wife</em>.</p>

is ſo potent either to procure
or merit Love, as
Valour, and I am glad I am
ſo, for thereby I ſhall do
my ſelf much eaſe, becauſe
Valour never needs much wit to maintain
it: To ſpeak of it in it ſelf, It is a quality
which he that hath, ſhall have leaſt need of,
so the beſt League between Princes is a
mutual fear of each other, it teacheth a man
to value his reputation as his life, and
chiefly to hold the Lye unſufferable, though
being alone, he holds finds no hurt it doth
him, It leaves it ſelf to others cenſures, for
he that brags of his own valour, diſſwades
others from believing it, It feareth a word
no more than an Ague, It always makes
good the Owner, for though he be generally
held a fool, he ſhall ſeldom hear ſo much
by word of mouth, and that enlargeth him
more than any ſpectacles, for it maketh a

 </span></span></a>little fellow be called a tall man, it yeilds
the wall to none but a woman, whoſe weakneſs
is her prerogative, or a man ſeconded
with a woman as an uſher, which always
goes before his betters, It makes a man become
the witneſs of his own words, and
ſtand to whatever he hath ſaid, and thinketh
it a reproach to commit his reviling unto
the Law, it furniſheth youth with action,
and age with diſcourſe, and both by futures,
for a man muſt ever boaſt himſelf in the
preſent tenſe, and to come nearer home,
nothing drawes a woman like to it; for
Valour towards men, is an Emblem of an
ability towards women, a good quality ſignifies
a better. Nothing is more behooffull
for that Sex; for from it they receive
protection, and we free from the danger of
it: Nothing makes a ſhorter cut for obtaining,
for a man of Arms is always void of
Ceremony, which is the wall that ſtands between
<cite>Pyramus</cite> and <cite>Thiſbe</cite>, that is, <em>Man</em> and
<em>Woman</em>, for there is no pride in women but
that which rebounds from our own baſeneſſe
(as Cowards grow valiant upon thoſe
that are more Cowards) ſo that only by our
pale aſking we teach them to deny, and by
our ſhamefac’dneſs, we put them in minde
to be modeſt, whereas indeed it is cunning
<a id="png.p077" href="#png.p077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><em>Rhetorick</em> to perſwade the hearers that they
are that already which he would have them
to be; This kinde of baſhfulneſs is far from
men of Valour, and eſpecially from ſouldiers,
for ſuch are ever men (without doubt) forward
and confident, loſing no time leaſt
they ſhould loſe opportunity, which is the
beſt Factor for a Lover, and becauſe they
know women are given to diſſemble, they
will never believe them when they deny,
<em>Whilome</em> before this age of wit, and wearing
black, were broke in upon us, there was no
way known to win a Lady but by Tylting,
Turnying, and riding through Forreſts, in
which time theſe ſlender ſtriplings with
little legs were held but of ſtrength enough
to marry their widows, and even in our
days there can be given no reaſon of the
Inundation of Servingmen upon their Miſtreſſes,
but (only) that uſually they carry
their Maſters Weapons, and his Valour: To
be accounted handſome, juſt, learned, or
well favoured, all this carries no danger
with it, but it is to be admitted to the Title
of Valiant Acts, at leaſt the adventuring of
his mortality, and al women take delight to
hold him safe in their arms who hath ’ſcapt
thither through many dangers: To ſpeak at
once, Man hath a priviledge in Valour; In
<a id="png.p078" href="#png.p078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>clothes and good faces we but imitate
women, and many of that Sex will not think
much (as far as an anſwer goes) to diſſemble
wit too. So then theſe neat youths, theſe
women in mens apparel are too near a
woman to be beloved of her, They be both
of a Trade, but be grim of aſpect, and ſuch
a one as Glaſs dares take, and ſhe will deſire
him for neatneſs and varietie; A ſkar in a
mans face is the ſame that a mole in a
womans; a Jewel ſet in white to make it
ſeem more white, for the ſkar in a man is a
mark of honour and no blemiſh, for ’tis a
ſkar and a blemiſh too in a Souldier too to
be with out one: Now as for al things elſe
which are to procure Love, as a good face,
wit, good clothes, or a good body, each of
them I confeſs may work ſomewhat for want
of a better, That is, if <em>Valour be not their
Rivall</em>; A good face avails nothing if it be in
a coward that is baſhfull, the utmoſt of it is
to be kiſſ’d, which rather encreaſeth then
quencheth appetite; He that ſends her gifts
ſends her word alſo, that he is a man of ſmall
gifts otherwiſe, for wooing by ſigns and
tokens implies the Author dumb; and if
<cite>Ovid</cite> who writ <cite>the Law of Love</cite>, were alive (as
he is extant) would allow it as good a diverſity,
that gifts ſhould be ſent as
<a id="png.p079" href="#png.p079"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>gratuities, not as bribes; Wit getteth rather
promiſe then Love, Wit is not to be ſeen,
and no woman takes advice of any in her
loving, but of her own eyes, and her waiting
womans; Nay which is worſe, wit is not to
be felt, and ſo no good fellow; Wit apply’d
to a woman makes her diſſolve (or diſcloſe)
her ſimpering, and diſcover her teeth with
laughter, and this is ſurely a purge for love;
for the beginning of love is a kind of fooliſh
melancholy, as for the man that makes his
Taylor his Bawd, and hopes to inveagle his
Love with ſuch a coloured ſuit, ſurely the
ſame deeply hazards the loſs of her favour
upon every change of his clothes; So likewiſe
for the other, that Courts her ſilently
with a good body, let me certifie him that
his clothes depend upon the comelyneſſe of
the body, and ſo both upon opinion; ſhe
that hath been ſeduced by Apparel, let me
give her to wit, <em>that men always put off their
clothes before they go to bed</em>; and let her that
hath been enamour’d of her ſervants body,
underſtand, <em>that if ſhe ſaw him in a ſkin of
cloth</em>, that is, in a ſuit made to the pattern of
his body, <em>ſhe would ſee ſlender cauſe to love
him ever after</em>; there are no clothes ſit ſo
well in a woman’s eye, as a ſuit of Steel,
though not of the faſhion, and no man ſo
<a id="png.p080" href="#png.p080"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>ſoon ſurpriſeth a womans affections as he
that is the ſubject of all whiſperings, and
hath always twenty ſtories of his own deeds
depending upon him; Miſtake me not, I
underſtand not by valour one that never
fights but when he is back’d by drink or
anger, or hiſſ’d on with beholders, nor one
that is deſperate, nor one that takes away
a Servingmans weapons when perchance it
coſt him his quarters wages, nor yet one
that wears a Privy coat of defence and
therein is confident, for then ſuch as made
Bucklers, would be accounted the <em>Catalines</em>
of this Commonwealth—I intend one of
an even Reſolution grounded upon reaſon,
which is always even, having his power reſtrained
by the Law of not doing wrong.
But now I remember I am for Valour and
therefore I muſt be a man of few words.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
